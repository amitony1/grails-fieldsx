h1. f:with

h2. Description

Places a bean in scope so that the bean attribute can be omitted on contained tags.

h2. Example

{code}
<f:with bean="person">
    <f:field property="name"/>
    <f:field property="address.city"/>
</f:with>
{code}

h3. Attributes

{table}
*Name* | *Required?* | *Description*
*bean* | yes | The bean whose property is being rendered. This can be the object itself or the name of a page-scope variable.
*prefix* | String | A string (including the trailing period) that should be appended before the input name such as @name="${prefix}propertyName"@.  The label is also modified.
{table}


 h2. Extra attributes (Since version 2.1.4)

 You can pass any number of extra attributes to the *with* tag that will be propagated to the inner fields and displays.

 {code}
 <f:with bean="person" wrapper="someWrapper">
     <f:field property="name"/>
     <f:field property="address.city"/>
 </f:with>
 {code}

 That way you don't need to repeat the same attribute over and over.
 The code above is the same as:

 {code}
 <f:with bean="person">
     <f:field property="name" wrapper="someWrapper"/>
     <f:field property="address.city" wrapper="someWrapper"/>
 </f:with>
 {code}

 h4. Override extra attributes

 You can override the extra attributes on any field just changing the attribute value on the popper field or display

 {code}
 <f:with bean="person" wrapper="someWrapper">
     <f:field property="name"/>
     <f:field property="address.city"/>
     <f:field property="address.zip" wrapper="differentWrapper"/>
 </f:with>
 {code}

 {note}
     Remember that if you want to use some of those attributes in the *widget* or *displayWidget* templates you need to prefix them with the *widget-* word (unless you have configured another prefix)
