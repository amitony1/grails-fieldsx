==== f:input (DEPRECATED)

===== Description

`f:input` renders an appropriate input for a property, for example an `<input type="text">` element for a `String` property or a `<select>` for an enum.

Since version 1.5 you can specify where the widget's template is located with the _widget_ attribute.


NOTE: Using `f:input` directly will only be necessary for very specialized cases, usually it will be invoked via `f:field`.


===== Attributes


`f:input` accepts exactly the same attributes as the link:field.html[f:field] tag (except for `wrapper` and `templates` attributes).


===== Deprecated since version 1.5

Use link:widget.html[f:widget] tag instead
